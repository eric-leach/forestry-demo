# The Third Wave of Identity Management

## Use Cases

Maverics is a simple, highly secure, open toolset used to integrate and migrate on-premises identity and access management systems to a cloud service provider's identity system.

The Maverics Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a very secure framework for integrating, authenticating to, and interacting with highly distributed systems made up of identity repositories or identity servers and clients, connectors, proxies, or agents.

The Maverics CLI allows you to configure and manage integrations with legacy identity systems and can be easily extended with modules required for installing, configuring, and managing the components needed to accomplish one-time and ongoing identity migration tasks. The Maverics CLI, provides a single centralized-point from which to manage highly distributed components and secure their interactions.
