Maverics was conceived to make migrating identity systems easier, faster, and (way) cheaper than it is today.

Maverics provides a command line client (Maverics CLI) with pre-built integrations with common on-premises identity management systems. The Maverics CLI integrates with:

* Active Directory
* LDAP
* Oracle Identity Manager/Identity Governance/Access Management/Directory
* CA Identity Management
* IBM Identity Management
* RDBMS

Use the Maverics CLI install, configure, and manage tools to discover, export, transform, and encrypt identities, configurations, and policies from these source identity systems in order to more easily migrate to target cloud identity systems including:

* Microsoft Azure AD
* AWS Cognito and AWS IAM
* Google Cloud Identity
* Okta Identity Cloud
* Strata Identity Platform

Maverics also specifies an identity infrastructure YAML syntax to improve the interoperability of configuration and policy data between on-premises identity systems and cloud identity systems.

Maverics also integrates with infrastructure and container orchestration platforms such as AirShip, Cloud Foundry, Terraform, and Kubernetes. Maverics declares the end state of the identity system to be deployed in support of the workloads and data deployed to the target platform.

Maverics is sponsored by strata.io.
